# FlappyBird_C++
* Simple Flappy Bird Game With C++
* You'll need a graphics library like SDL or SFML for the graphical elements.
* I'll use SDL for simplicity. Make sure you have SDL installed and set up in your development environment.
* You'll need to replace "bird.png" with the path to your bird image
